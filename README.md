1. What is React ?
------------------

React JS is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. It was created by Facebook and was first released in 2013. React is widely used by developers to build interactive and dynamic web applications that can handle a large amount of data and complex state management.

React follows a component-based architecture, which means that UIs are divided into small and reusable components. Each component has its own logic and can be easily combined with other components to create complex UIs. React also uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and render changes to the UI without reloading the entire page.

React has gained popularity in recent years due to its ease of use, flexibility, and performance. It is often used in combination with other libraries and frameworks, such as Redux and Next.js, to create more complex web applications.
